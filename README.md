# Higurashi PS3-exclusive Arcs Patch for PC version

This patch aims to eventually port all the arcs from the PS3 version of Higurashi to Mangagamer's Steam release of Higurashi.  This is a large task and it will take a long time to port them all, so each arc will be rolled out one at a time.

## Current Status

| Chapter     | PC Port  | Translation | Editing |
| ----------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Someutsushi | 100%     | 100%        | 100%    | 
| Kageboushi  | 100%     |   0%        |   0%    | 

Someutsushi is complete, including all the TIPS and the omake sequence.  Kageboushi is pully ported to PC, but only playable in Japanese at the moment.  Beginning translation.

## Requirements
Installation requires a copy of Ch 4 Himatsubushi, either the Steam version or directly from Mangagamer's website.  The patch converts a Himatsubushi installation into one that can theoretically play all of the console arcs.

## Installation Instructions
1. Install Higurashi Ch.4 Himatsubushi on your computer.  (If you're using the Steam version, I recommend changing the default installation directory to somewhere other than C:\program files. Windows doesn't like when you modify files in program files)
2. Download the latest release of the Console Arcs Patch [Here.](https://github.com/07th-mod/higurashi-console-arcs/releases/latest)
3. Navigate to the directory where Himatsubushi is installed on your computer and drill down to "\Higurashi 04 - Himatsubushi\HigurashiEp04_Data\StreamingAssets"
4. Delete the existing BGM, CGAlt, SE, and Update folders under the StreamingAssets directory.
5. Extract the BGM, CGAlt, SE, and Update folders from the higurashi-console-arcs-ver1.1.rar file into the StreamingAssets directory.
6. Launch the application by using the HigurashiEp04.exe executable in the "\Higurashi 04 - Himatsubushi" directory
7. The first time you launch the application, it will spend 10-15 seconds processing the new script files before it loads.  I won't do this on subsequent launches.

## Recruiting

Looking for people interested in helping with the rest of the arcs!  I could use a more experienced translator or two to handle the other arcs, or fix any translation issues in the existing translation (This is the first time I've translated anything, so it's not the best). And it would be great to have an editor or two to fix any spelling/grammar errors.  Any help would be appreciated.
