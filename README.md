# Higurashi Console Arcs

This patch ports all 10 original arcs added in the various console versions of Higurashi (PS2/DS/PS3/Switch) to Mangagamer's Steam release of Higurashi, complete with English translation.

Here's a [flowchart](http://07th-mod.com/wiki/Higurashi/img/flow.png) that explains where all these arcs fit in with the main series and the recommended reading order.

Here's a [walkthrough](http://07th-mod.com/wiki/Higurashi/img/walk-yoig.png) for anyone who wants to know which choices in Yoigoshi lead to which endings.

And here's a [walkthrough](http://07th-mod.com/wiki/Higurashi/img/walk-omot.jpg) for Miotsukushi Omote.
