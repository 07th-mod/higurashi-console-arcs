# Higurashi PS3-exclusive Arcs Patch for PC version

This patch aims to eventually port all the arcs from the PS3 version of Higurashi to Mangagamer's Steam release of Higurashi.  This is a large task and it will take a long time to port them all, so each arc will be rolled out one at a time.

Here's a [flowchart](http://07th-mod.com/wiki/Higurashi/img/flow.png) that explains where all these arcs fit in with the main series and the recommended reading order.

Here's a [walkthrough](http://07th-mod.com/wiki/Higurashi/img/walk-yoig.png) for anyone who wants to know which choices in Yoigoshi lead to which endings.

And here's a [walkthrough](http://07th-mod.com/wiki/Higurashi/img/walk-omot.jpg) for Miotsukushi Omote.

Hajisarashi translation is complete! There are still a bunch of little things that need to be done before release, but it should take a couple weeks at most.

## Requirements
Installation requires a copy of Ch 4 Himatsubushi, either the Steam version or the DRM-free version from Mangagamer's website.  The patch converts a Himatsubushi installation into one that can play all the arcs listed above.

## Installation Instructions
Installation instructions can be found on the [wiki](http://07th-mod.com/wiki/Higurashi/Higurashi-Part-1---Voice-and-Graphics-Patch/).


## Recruiting

Looking for people interested in helping with the rest of the arcs!  I could use a more experienced translator or two to handle the other arcs, or fix any translation issues in the existing translation (This is the first time I've translated anything, so it's not the best). And it would be great to have an editor or two to fix any spelling/grammar errors.  Any help would be appreciated.
