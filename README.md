# Higurashi PS3-exclusive Arcs Patch for PC version

This patch aims to eventually port all the arcs from the PS3 version of Higurashi to Mangagamer's Steam release of Higurashi.  This is a large task and it will take a long time to port them all, so each arc will be rolled out one at a time.

## Current Status

Someutsushi 
- [x] Ported to the PC engine
- [ ] Tanslated

Someutsushi is playable in Japanese. Other arcs will be ported once Someutsushi is Translated.

## Requirements
Requires a copy of Ch 4 Himatsubishi.  The patch converts a Himatsubushi installation into one that can theoretically play all of the console arcs.

Why Himatsubushi?  Because it's able to present the user with choices, which is necessary so the user can select which arc to start.  Choices didn't work correctly in Onikakushi, so I went with Hima.

## Latest Release

The release page contains installation instructions and patch files.

## Known Issues

- The engine can't handle certain Japanese kanji (such as è¨Š) so they display as a red X.  Not sure if this can be fixed by changing the font or something.  May have to change the Japanese text to write the words out in hiragana or use synonyms.
