# Higurashi PS3-exclusive Arcs Patch for PC version

This patch aims to eventually port all the arcs from the PS3 version of Higurashi to Mangagamer's Steam release of Higurashi.  This is a large task and it will take a long time to port them all, so each arc will be rolled out one at a time.

Here's a [flowchart](https://ibb.co/dTRmmb) that explains where all these arcs fit in with the main series and the recommended reading order.

## Current Status

| Chapter      | PC Port  | Translation | Editing |
| ------------ | -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Someutsushi  | 100%     | 100%        | 100%    | 
| Kageboushi   | 100%     | 100%        | 100%    | 
| Tsukiotoshi  | 100%     | 100%        | 100%    | 
| Taraimawashi | 100%     | 100%        | 100%    | 
| Yoigoshi     | 100%     | 100%        |  36%    | 

Yoigoshi translation is complete, and editing has begun.  Hoping for a full release in late January.

## Requirements
Installation requires a copy of Ch 4 Himatsubushi, either the Steam version or the DRM-free version from Mangagamer's website.  The patch converts a Himatsubushi installation into one that can play all three of the currently released console arcs.

## Installation Instructions
### Automated installer (Windows only)

The automated installer will drop all the necessary files in the appropriate locations.  You can download the new universal installer: [Here](https://github.com/07th-mod/Higurashi_Installer_WPF/releases/latest).  This is the same installer used for all the main arcs, too.

After downloading the installer, run it as Administrator and click the ``Console Arcs`` button, then click ``Select Folder`` and set the installation directory to your ``Higurashi 04 - Himatsubushi`` Steam game directory (also works for MangaGamer's DRM free release), and then hit the Install/Update button to kick off the install.

If you are unsure **where** the Steam game is located, find it in your Steam library, right-click on it and choose ``Properties``. In the new window that just opened, click on the ``LOCAL FILES`` tab and then on the ``Browse local files...`` button. Now you should be able to see where your game is located in Windows Explorer.

### Manual Installation (Windows, Mac, linux)

1. Download all five of the following archives:
[BGM](https://07th-mod.com/rikachama/ConsoleArcs-BGM.7z), [CG](https://07th-mod.com/rikachama/ConsoleArcs-CG.7z), [SE](https://07th-mod.com/rikachama/ConsoleArcs-SE.7z), [voice](https://07th-mod.com/rikachama/ConsoleArcs-Voices.7z), and the appropriate UI mod for your operating system ([Windows UI](https://07th-mod.com/rikachama/Himatsubushi-UI.7z) / [Mac/Linux UI](https://07th-mod.com/rikachama/Himatsubushi-UI_UNIX.7z))
2. Download the [latest version of the patch](https://github.com/07th-mod/higurashi-console-arcs/releases/latest)
3. Navigate to the ``Higurashi 04 - Himatsubushi\`` directory on your local system
4. Extract all six archives inside the ``Higurashi 04 - Himatsubushi\`` directory
5. You can play the console arcs by running ``HigurashiEp04.exe``, which is in the ``Higurashi 04 - Himatsubushi`` directory. 
6. The first time you launch the application, it will spend 10-15 seconds processing the new script files before it loads.  It won't do this on subsequent launches.

## Recruiting

Looking for people interested in helping with the rest of the arcs!  I could use a more experienced translator or two to handle the other arcs, or fix any translation issues in the existing translation (This is the first time I've translated anything, so it's not the best). And it would be great to have an editor or two to fix any spelling/grammar errors.  Any help would be appreciated.
