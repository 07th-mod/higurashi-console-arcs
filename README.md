# Higurashi PS3-exclusive Arcs Patch for PC version

This patch aims to eventually port all the arcs from the PS3 version of Higurashi to Mangagamer's Steam release of Higurashi.  This is a large task and it will take a long time to port them all, so each arc will be rolled out one at a time.

Here's a [flowchart](http://07th-mod.com/wiki/Higurashi/img/flow.png) that explains where all these arcs fit in with the main series and the recommended reading order.

Here's a [walkthrough](http://07th-mod.com/wiki/Higurashi/img/walk-yoig.png) for anyone who wants to know which choices in Yoigoshi lead to which endings.

And here's a [walkthrough](http://07th-mod.com/wiki/Higurashi/img/walk-omot.jpg) for Miotsukushi Omote.
